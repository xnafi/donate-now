                        Flood is an integral part of Bangladesh and so is the suffering of the people living in flood-prone areas. Unlike cyclone shelters, very few designated 
                        flood shelters exist in Bangladesh; this is because of the difference in the nature of these two phenomena.

            From now through June 10, 2022, several relief agencies are staffing a free hotline for debris removal and home cleanup after the recent mudslides and flooding.

            This hotline will connect affected residents with reputable and vetted relief agencies that will assist in chainsaw work, debris removal, drywall, flooring and appliance removal, roof tarping, and mold treatment, as they are able. All services are free, but service is not guaranteed due to the overwhelming need.
